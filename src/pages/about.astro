          How It Started
        </h2>
        <p class="text-charcoal mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          It began with a flat white in Melbourne. I was used to thinking of coffee as just caffeine
          delivery - something to get through morning meetings. But that first sip of properly
          extracted specialty coffee changed everything. The complexity, the fruit notes, the way
          it tasted nothing like the bitter brew I'd been drinking my whole life.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading text-2xl font-bold text-espresso mb-4">
          The Mission
        </h2>
        <p class="text-charcoal mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Now, wherever I travel, finding great coffee is part of the adventure. This site is my
          way of documenting those discoveries - the hidden gems, the beans worth seeking out,
          and the shops that remind me why specialty coffee is worth the hunt.

          What I Look For

            <span class="text-rust font-bold">→</span>
            <span><strong>Quality over convenience</strong> - Third wave shops that care about sourcing and extraction</span>

            <span class="text-rust font-bold">→</span>
            <span><strong>Atmosphere matters</strong> - Spaces designed for enjoying coffee, not just grabbing it</span>

            <span class="text-rust font-bold">→</span>
            <span><strong>Light to medium roasts</strong> - I want to taste the origin, not the roaster's char</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
            <span class="text-rust font-bold">→</span>
            <span><strong>Filter coffee</strong> - Pour-over, Aeropress, batch brew - that's my preference</span>
