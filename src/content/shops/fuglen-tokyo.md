## First Impressions

Walking into Fuglen feels like stepping into a Scandinavian living room from the 1950s. The vintage furniture, warm lighting, and the smell of freshly brewed coffee create an atmosphere that's both cozy and sophisticated.

## The Space

The shop occupies a corner spot in the quiet Tomigaya neighborhood, away from the crowds of Shibuya. Floor-to-ceiling windows let natural light flood the space during the day, while Edison bulbs create a warm glow in the evening.

## The Coffee

They source their beans from Norway and the quality shows. I had a pour-over of their Ethiopian single origin - bright, fruity, with notes of bergamot and citrus. Easily one of the best cups I've had in Tokyo.

## Would I Return?

Absolutely. This is the kind of place you want to spend an afternoon with a good book and multiple cups of coffee.
