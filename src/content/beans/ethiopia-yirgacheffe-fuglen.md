## Tasting Notes

This is a textbook example of what a great washed Ethiopian should taste like. The first sip hits you with bright citrus - think Meyer lemon and orange zest. As it cools, floral notes emerge, almost like jasmine tea.

## Brewing Method

Had this as a pour-over at Fuglen Tokyo. The barista used a V60 with a 1:15 ratio, which really let the delicate flavors shine through.

## The Verdict

One of those beans that reminds you why specialty coffee is worth seeking out. Light and complex, but still satisfying. Would love to get a bag to brew at home.
